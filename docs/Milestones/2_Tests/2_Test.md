# Task Runner

+ ## :checkered_flag: npm 
    
    Default package manager in Node.js, and through npm scripts, you can automate tasks easily.
    ### Differences:
    npm scripts are a built-in feature in Node.js and do not require the installation of an additional tool.
    Tasks are defined in the package.json file under the "scripts" section and are executed with npm run script-name.
    ### Key Features:
    You can automate common tasks, such as starting the Express server, running tests, managing dependencies, and more.
    It is highly customizable and offers flexibility to define custom tasks.
    Ideal for small to medium-sized projects that do not require the complexity of external tools.

+ ## Grunt
    Grunt is a widely used task runner that allows you to automate a variety of tasks in Node.js projects.
    ### Differences:
    Grunt uses a JSON-based configuration file called Gruntfile.js to define tasks.
    It provides a wide range of pre-defined plugins for common tasks.
    ### Key Features:
    JSON-based configuration that is easy to understand and customize.
    Abundance of plugins available for various tasks, including minification, compilation, test execution, etc.
    Suitable for medium to large projects with more complex workflows.

+ ## Mocha
    Mocha is a popular testing library in Node.js that allows you to write and execute tests effectively.
    ### Differences:
    Unlike task runners, Mocha focuses on writing and executing unit and integration tests rather than automating build tasks.
    It does not require the definition of tasks in configuration files; instead, you write test suites in test files.
    ### Key Features:
    Provides a simple and clear syntax for writing tests.
    Supports various testing styles (BDD, TDD, exports, etc.).
    Offers a wide range of plugins and assertion libraries to customize your tests.
    Can be integrated with Grunt or npm scripts to automate test execution as part of your workflow.



# Assertion/Test Library

+ ## Chai:
    ### Differences:
    Offers multiple test writing styles, such as BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) and TDD (Test-Driven Development).
    Extremely flexible and customizable.
    Provides a readable syntax for making assertions.
    ### Key Features:
    Widely used in Node.js and JavaScript projects.
    Integrates well with Mocha and other testing frameworks.
    Facilitates the writing of readable and expressive tests.

+ ## :checkered_flag: Jest:
    Type of Library: Complete testing framework with its assertion library.
    ### Differences:
    Includes both a testing framework and an assertion library.
    Provides timer simulation functions for testing asynchronous code.
    Primarily designed for JavaScript and React projects but can be used with Node.js Express.
    ### Key Features:
    Easy to set up and use, especially for JavaScript-based projects.
    Offers parallel testing and real-time change detection (watch mode).
    Provides a complete framework for writing tests, including assertions.

+ ## :checkered_flag: SuperTest:
    ### Differences:
    Designed for making HTTP requests to your REST API and making assertions about the responses.
    Not an assertion library itself; it is used in conjunction with assertion libraries like Chai or Jest.
    Ideal for end-to-end testing and API validation.
    
    ### Key Features:
    Simplifies making HTTP requests and evaluating responses in integration tests.
    Can be used with testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest to perform comprehensive API REST tests.
    Facilitates request simulation and real-time response handling.
