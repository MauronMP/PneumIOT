## TL:DR

This project aims to implement an environmental monitoring system in the homes of affected patients.
This system would be designed to carry out an exhaustive analysis of the air quality in the home environment. In this way, it would be possible to assess the patient's condition while they are at home, allowing a more accurate study of possible relapses to which they are prone due to the chronic nature of their condition.
The target population for this study focuses on patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other recurrent respiratory conditions. These people are particularly susceptible to air quality, and small variations in pollutant levels or humidity can have a significant impact on their health and quality of life.

## Abstract

Currently, it is increasingly common for people, especially during autumn
and winter, to frequently visit healthcare centers to treat pulmonary issues,
resulting in a high rate of recurring patients. The objective of this project is
to conduct a study of the patient’s home environment using a digital system
capable of collecting the most relevant data. These data will be processed
to provide the doctor with a clear understanding of potential home-related
problems that could be negatively affecting the patient’s health. With this
information, the aim is to improve the quality of treatment and offer more
personalized care to each patient.
In addition to focusing on the study of patients’ homes, this project
has the potential to be scaled to include other locations, such as residences
and different environments. These expansions would be considered as future
improvements to the system, allowing its utility and benefits to be extended
to a broader range of people. In this way, the goal is to create a versatile and
adaptable solution that can be applied in various situations and contexts,
thus providing a greater positive impact on the health and well-being of
individuals.
